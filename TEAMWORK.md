## Communication  

+ GitHub Issues: We will use GitHub Issues to track tasks, report bugs, and discuss feature requests. Each team member should check GitHub Issues daily and respond promptly to comments or assignments.
+ Slack: We will maintain an active Slack channel for quick and informal communication. While we don't expect immediate responses, we should aim to reply to messages within 30 minutes during our working hours.
+ Regular Meetings: We will hold a weekly team meeting after class to discuss progress, challenges, and upcoming tasks. This meeting will serve as an opportunity to synchronize our efforts and address any blockers.
+ Pull Request Reviews: Each team member will review pull requests from others as soon as possible after submission. Reviews should be thorough but constructive, aiming to improve the overall quality of our project.
