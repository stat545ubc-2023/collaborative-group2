# How-to instructions

1. This is a milestone project marking the first few weeks of our STAT545 class. We are practicing how to use GitHub and RStudio. 
2. The files in our GitHub repo are the "README.md" file you are currently reading, the "TEAMWORK.md" file that details our rules for group work and division of labour, and the "troubleshooting-1.Rmd" file that we will use to practice fixing errors.
3. You can run this by downloading the files and opening them in RStudio.
