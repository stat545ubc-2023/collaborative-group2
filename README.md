# How-to instructions

1. This is a milestone project marking the first few weeks of our STAT545 class. We are practicing how to collaboratively work on code using GitHub and edit/view it using RStudio. 
2. The files in our GitHub repo are the "README.md" file you are currently reading, the "TEAMWORK.md" file that details our rules for group work and division of labour, and the "troubleshooting-1.Rmd" file that we will use to practice fixing errors.
3. You can run this code by opening them in RStudio. To do this, you must create a new project in RStudio and choose version control. Then, you should click the **code** button on the GitHub repository, copy the link, and paste that into the prompt in RStudio. Then, you should click **pull**, which will ensure you are working with the most recent files. Make sure you are working in your own branch! You can then edit the files as you please, commit these changes, and then click the **push** button to send these changes to GitHub.

## The list of files in the collaborative project repository:
